# KappaGen
KappaGen uses your broadcasting software's browser source to display emotes and emote effects from your Twitch chat on your stream. You can customize it through your browser and custom effects can be set for when someone follows or subscribes to your stream.
 
## Usage
The easiest way to get started is to use our hosted version at [https://cbenni.com/kappagen/settings/](https://cbenni.com/kappagen/settings/). Here you can configure what you want KappaGen to look and act like and you will be given a url to put into your browser source in eg. OBS Studio, XSplit or any other broadcasting software that supports browser sources. We have a [quick setup guide on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cVMAwWLMN0).
 
You can also host the resources yourself. Just download the [ZIP](https://github.com/CBenni/KappaGen/archive/master.zip) with the latest HTML and JavaScript and serve it statically. You may want to remove the Google Analytics block from `index.html`.
 
## Features
* Customize it with user rate limits, emote sizes and emote effects.
* Optionally enable support for BetterTTV and FrankerFaceZ global and channel emotes.
* Optionally limit emotes to just emotes from your channel and ignore global emotes.
* Optional emoticon explosion effect when someone follows or subscribes with support for alternative subscriptions through GameWisp.
* Allow your moderators to change settings to counteract spam.
* No login required. All resources are served statically.
* Different animations for emotes:
 - zoom: emote zooms in and out again
 - bubble: similar to the periscope hearts
 - blur: blurring the emote in and out of view
 - bounce: solitaire-style bouncing emotes

## Future development plans
I am currently happy with the software as such, but I will be adding things as they get requested!
I would be happy for any feedback, since only with feedback can I improve the app :)
